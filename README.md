Each section of this guide contains notes about a different topic. The key focuses of this site are: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. If we open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running in the background. It will list the topics I learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. This is a study guide to support yours, and my, study.
